# Codename: Ruku, The Backend for Sujud

## Purpose

Sujud is a comprehensive and versatile solution for managing all aspects of a mosque's operations. This software provides a holistic approach to mosque management by focusing on various components such as announcements, classes, committees, events, donations, fundraising campaigns, prayer schedules, resources, services, and volunteer tasks.

## Technology

Sujud uses a serverless architecture, leveraging AWS Amplify as the backend. AWS Amplify provides an easy way to develop and deploy secure, scalable full stack applications. Our schema is based on GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data.
